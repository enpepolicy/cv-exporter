# Active Context

## Current Focus

- **Icon System Replacement**: Transitioned from Font Awesome to native emojis for all icons.
- **Visual Verification**: Ensuring emojis render correctly and maintain visual appeal.

## Recent Changes

- **Font Awesome Removal**:
    - Replaced all `<font-awesome-icon>` components in `src/App.vue` with corresponding emojis:
        - PDF Export: üìÑ
        - Image Export: üñºÔ∏è
        - Email: üìß
        - Phone: üìû
        - Location: üìç
        - LinkedIn: üíº
        - External Link (Experience): ‚ÜóÔ∏è (styling also changed to remove circular background)
    - Removed Font Awesome imports and global component registration from `src/main.js`.
    - Removed Font Awesome dependencies from `package.json` (`@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core`, `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`, `@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons`, `@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome`).
- **Memory Bank Updates**:
    - `techContext.md` updated to reflect emoji usage and removal of Font Awesome.
    - `systemPatterns.md` updated to reflect emoji usage and removal of Font Awesome.

**Previous PDF/Styling Iterations (Context Kept for Reference):**
- **Iteration 1**: General PDF robustness (overflow, wrapping, page breaks, line heights).
- **Iteration 2 (Targeted Icon/Chip Fixes - Pre-Emoji)**: Granular alignment for header icons (wrapping icon-text pairs), external link icon, and `align-middle` for skill chips.
- **Iteration 3 (Skill Chip Container Fix)**: Added `align-content-start` to the skill chip container div.
- **Iteration 4 (Header Contact Block Structure - Pre-Emoji)**: Structural changes to header contact info for alignment.

## Next Steps

- **Run `npm install`**: To finalize the removal of Font Awesome packages from `node_modules` and update `package-lock.json`. (User previously denied, will re-attempt or await confirmation).
- **Visual Testing**:
    - Run the development server (`npm run dev`).
    - Use browser tools to visually inspect the application:
        - Confirm all emojis are displayed correctly.
        - Check layout and alignment around new emojis.
        - Verify the new external link icon (‚ÜóÔ∏è) style.
- **Functional Testing**:
    - Test PDF export functionality.
    - Test image export functionality.
- **Update `progress.md`**: Document the successful transition to emojis and the removal of Font Awesome.
- **Address any visual or functional issues** that arise from the emoji replacement.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Emoji for Icons**: Switched to native emojis for simplicity and to remove an external dependency. This may have implications for cross-browser/OS rendering consistency, but is generally well-supported.
- **Styling Adjustments for Emojis**: Emojis are treated as text characters, so their alignment and spacing might need different considerations than font icons. The external link icon style was explicitly changed.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Tailwind CSS for Styling**: Continue to leverage Tailwind utility classes for any adjustments needed around emojis.
- **Dependency Minimization**: Removing Font Awesome simplifies the project's dependencies.

## Learnings & Project Insights

- Replacing an icon library with emojis can reduce dependencies but requires careful testing of visual consistency and alignment.
- User feedback is crucial for catching missed details or undesired styling changes during refactoring.
