# Progress

## What Works (as of Font Awesome to Emoji Migration)

- **Local Development Server (`npm run dev`)**: Fully functional.
- **Dependencies**: All managed via npm. Font Awesome removed, emojis used for icons.
- **GitHub Action Build (`npm run build` in CI)**: Assumed successful pending `npm install` and commit.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment Runtime (`https://enpepolicy.github.io/cv-exporter/`)**: Assumed functional pending `npm install`, commit, and deployment of new changes.
- **Icon Replacement**: Font Awesome icons replaced with emojis in `src/App.vue`.
- **Code Cleanup**: Font Awesome references removed from `src/main.js` and `package.json`.
- **Memory Bank Updated**: `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `activeContext.md` reflect the icon system change.

**Previous PDF/Styling Iterations (Context Kept for Reference):**
- **Iteration 1**: General PDF robustness (overflow, wrapping, page breaks, line heights).
- **Iteration 2 (Targeted Icon/Chip Fixes - Pre-Emoji)**: Granular alignment for header icons, external link icon, and `align-middle` for skill chips.
- **Iteration 3 (Skill Chip Container Fix)**: Added `align-content-start` to the skill chip container div.
- **Iteration 4 (Header Contact Block Structure - Pre-Emoji)**: Structural changes to header contact info for alignment.

## What's Left to Build / Verify

- **`npm install` Execution**: Finalize removal of Font Awesome packages from `node_modules` and update `package-lock.json`. (User previously denied, awaiting confirmation/re-attempt).
- **Visual Testing (Post-Emoji)**:
    - Confirm all emojis display correctly across different browsers/OS if possible.
    - Check layout and alignment around new emojis in `src/App.vue`.
    - Verify the new external link icon (↗️) style.
- **Functional Testing**:
    - Test PDF export functionality (check for regressions and new emoji rendering).
    - Test image export functionality (check for regressions and new emoji rendering).
- **Labels in `cvs.json`**:
    - User needs to ensure that each CV object in `src/cvs.json` contains a `labels` object with appropriate translations for UI elements for full localization functionality (ongoing consideration).
- **General Testing**: Further testing of all features on the deployed site is always recommended after these changes.

## Current Status

- **Icon System Refactor**: Successfully transitioned from Font Awesome to native emojis.
- **Dependency Management**: Font Awesome dependencies removed from `package.json`. `npm install` pending.
- **Data Handling**: `cvs.json` is a local module, imported and transformed.
- **Deployment**: Awaiting `npm install` and then deployment of these changes.
- **PDF Styling**: Previous styling iterations are in place; testing with new emojis is needed.

## Known Issues

- **(Resolved)** GitHub Action build failure due to missing Font Awesome package (this issue should remain resolved as FA is now removed).
- **(Resolved)** GitHub Pages serving incorrect files due to misconfigured deployment source, leading to 404 for `main.js`.
- **(Potential)** UI labels might not update correctly if `labels` objects are missing or incomplete in `src/cvs.json`.
- **(Pending Verification - Post-Emoji)** Visual rendering and alignment of emojis.
- **(Pending Verification - Post-Emoji)** PDF/Image export rendering with emojis.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial State**: CDN-based, single `index.html`, `http-server`.
- ... (previous decisions remain the same) ...
- **Problem 6 (PDF Export - Initial Report)**: PDF export has cropping, misalignment, and issues with "chip" elements.
- **Decision 6 (Iteration 1)**: General styling changes for PDF robustness.
- **Problem 7 (PDF Export - Feedback on Iteration 1)**: Specific alignment issues persist for header icons, external link icon, and skill chips.
- **Decision 7 (Iteration 2)**: Granular styling adjustments for icons and added `align-middle` to skill chips.
- **Problem 8 (PDF Export - Feedback on Iteration 2)**: Skill chip alignment in PDF still problematic (likely wrapped line alignment).
- **Decision 8 (Iteration 3)**: Added `align-content-start` to the parent `div` of skill chips to control the alignment of wrapped lines.
- **Problem 9 (Icon System)**: User request to replace Font Awesome icons with emojis and remove Font Awesome.
- **Decision 9 (Current)**: Replaced Font Awesome icons with emojis in `src/App.vue`, removed Font Awesome from `src/main.js` and `package.json`. Updated Memory Bank. `npm install` and testing are next.
- **Current State**: Project icon system refactored to use emojis. Awaiting `npm install` and thorough testing.
