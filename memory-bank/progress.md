# Progress

## What Works (as of Vite Migration)

- **Local Development Server (`npm run dev`)**:
    - Application runs successfully after migrating to Vite.
    - Vue.js initializes correctly from `src/App.vue`.
    - CV data is imported from `src/cvs.json` and processed.
    - Language and version switching are functional.
    - CV content displays dynamically.
    - PDF and Image export functionalities are working.
    - Styling with Tailwind CSS and global styles is applied.
    - JSON-LD metadata is updated.
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies (Vue, Tailwind, Font Awesome, export libraries) are managed via npm and correctly bundled/processed by Vite for local development.

## What's Left to Build / Verify

- **GitHub Action Build (`npm run build` in CI)**:
    - Previously failed due to missing `@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons` in `package.json`.
    - This dependency has now been added to `package.json`.
    - **Action item for user**: Commit and push updated `package.json` and re-run the GitHub Action.
- **Production Build Test (`npm run preview` locally)**:
    - After a successful `npm run build` (locally or in CI), the production build in `dist/` should be tested.
- **Labels in `cvs.json`**:
    - User needs to ensure that each CV object in `src/cvs.json` contains a `labels` object with appropriate translations for UI elements (e.g., "Select Language", "Experience") for full localization functionality.

## Current Status

- **Major Architectural Refactor Completed**: Project successfully migrated from a CDN-based single HTML file to a Vite-powered build system.
- **Dependency Management**: Switched from CDNs to npm for all key libraries.
- **Data Handling**: `cvs.json` is now a local module imported into `src/App.vue`, with data transformation logic implemented.
- **Troubleshooting**:
    - Resolved local `npm run dev` errors related to Font Awesome and `cvs.json` data structure.
    - Identified and fixed the missing `@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons` dependency in `package.json`, which was causing GitHub Action build failures.
- **Pending User Action**: User needs to commit changes and test the GitHub Action build.

## Known Issues

- **(Resolved)** GitHub Action build failure due to missing Font Awesome package. (Fix applied to `package.json`, pending CI test).
- **(Potential)** UI labels might not update correctly if `labels` objects are missing or incomplete in `src/cvs.json`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial State**: CDN-based, single `index.html`, `http-server` for local serving, `cvs.json` in `public/` fetched via HTTP.
- **Problem 1**: Original deployment issue (module specifier "vue" not resolved) due to import map problems.
- **Decision 1**: Migrate to a Vite build system to handle dependencies and build robustly.
    - This involved setting up `package.json`, Vite config, Tailwind config, PostCSS config.
    - Refactoring `index.html` to a template.
    - Moving all app logic to `src/App.vue` and styles to `src/assets/main.css`.
- **Problem 2**: `npm run dev` errors due to missing Font Awesome package (`@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons`).
- **Decision 2**: Add missing package to `package.json`.
- **Problem 3**: `npm run dev` errors ("Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')") due to mismatch between `cvs.json` flat structure and `App.vue`'s expected nested structure.
- **Decision 3**:
    - Move `cvs.json` to `src/` and import it directly.
    - Implement data transformation logic in `App.vue` (`processCVs` method) to convert flat data to nested.
    - Add defensive coding in `App.vue` for data access.
- **Problem 4 (CI)**: GitHub Action build failing with the same Font Awesome missing package error.
- **Decision 4**: Re-confirmed and fixed `package.json` to include `@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons`. User to push and re-test CI.
- **Current State**: Project uses Vite, npm dependencies, direct JSON import with transformation. Awaiting CI build confirmation.
