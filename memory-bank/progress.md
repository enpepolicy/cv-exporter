# Progress

## What Works

- **Local Development Server (`npm run dev`)**: Fully functional.
- **Dependencies**: All managed via npm. Font Awesome successfully removed.
- **Icon System**: Font Awesome icons fully replaced with native emojis in `src/App.vue`. Visuals and export functionality verified.
- **Code Cleanup**: Font Awesome references removed from `src/main.js` and `package.json`.
- **CV Data Refactoring (Phase 1)**:
    - `src/cvs.json` converted to `src/cvsData.js` (JavaScript module).
    - `src/App.vue` updated to import data from `src/cvsData.js`.
    - Common data sections (personal info base, education, honors/awards, references base) and skill sets (frontend, fullstack, blockchain) refactored into shared constants within `src/cvsData.js`.
    - These constants are now used across all CV entries for the respective sections, significantly reducing data duplication.
    - Application tested and confirmed functional after these data refactoring steps.
- **New Experience Added**: "Blockchain Engineer at Alloy (Contract)" experience added to all CV versions in `src/cvsData.js`, with tailored descriptions for each language and CV type. External URL `https://www.alloy.capital/` also added.
- **Memory Bank Updated**: `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `activeContext.md` reflect the icon system change and the initial data refactoring. `activeContext.md` also updated for the new Alloy experience and its external URL.

**Previous PDF/Styling Iterations (Context Kept for Reference):**
- **Iteration 1**: General PDF robustness (overflow, wrapping, page breaks, line heights).
- **Iteration 2 (Targeted Icon/Chip Fixes - Pre-Emoji)**: Granular alignment for header icons, external link icon, and `align-middle` for skill chips.
- **Iteration 3 (Skill Chip Container Fix)**: Added `align-content-start` to the skill chip container div.
- **Iteration 4 (Header Contact Block Structure - Pre-Emoji)**: Structural changes to header contact info for alignment.

## What's Left to Build / Verify

- **`npm install` Execution**: Still pending to finalize removal of Font Awesome packages from `node_modules` and update `package-lock.json`. (User previously denied, awaiting confirmation/re-attempt).
- **CV Data Refactoring (Phase 2 - Experience Section)**: Further de-duplication of the `experience` section in `src/cvsData.js` by creating base experience objects and localized details (if desired by user).
- **Deletion of `src/cvs.json`**: Pending user confirmation after successful refactor and testing of `src/cvsData.js`.
- **Labels in `cvsData.js`**: User needs to ensure that each CV object in `src/cvsData.js` (or the common structures it uses) contains a `labels` object with appropriate translations for UI elements for full localization functionality (ongoing consideration).
- **General Testing**: Further testing of all features on the deployed site is always recommended after these significant changes.

## Current Status

- **Icon System Refactor**: Completed. Emojis are in use and tested.
- **Dependency Management**: Font Awesome dependencies removed from `package.json`. `npm install` still pending.
- **Data Handling**: CV data migrated to `src/cvsData.js`, a JavaScript module. Common sections (personal_info base, education, honors, references base, skills) have been de-duplicated using shared constants. The module exports a flat array compatible with `App.vue`.
- **Deployment**: Awaiting `npm install` and then deployment of these changes.
- **PDF Styling**: Verified with emojis.

## Known Issues

- **(Resolved)** GitHub Action build failure due to missing Font Awesome package.
- **(Resolved)** GitHub Pages serving incorrect files due to misconfigured deployment source.
- **(Potential)** UI labels might not update correctly if `labels` objects are missing or incomplete in `cvsData.js`.
- **(Verified)** Visual rendering and alignment of emojis appear correct.
- **(Verified)** PDF/Image export rendering with emojis functions correctly.
- **(Observation)** A 404 error for an unspecified resource was observed in the browser console during `npm run dev`. This did not affect the tested functionality but may warrant investigation if other issues arise.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial State**: CDN-based, single `index.html`, `http-server`.
- ... (previous decisions remain the same) ...
- **Problem 6 (PDF Export - Initial Report)**: PDF export has cropping, misalignment, and issues with "chip" elements.
- **Decision 6 (Iteration 1)**: General styling changes for PDF robustness.
- **Problem 7 (PDF Export - Feedback on Iteration 1)**: Specific alignment issues persist for header icons, external link icon, and skill chips.
- **Decision 7 (Iteration 2)**: Granular styling adjustments for icons and added `align-middle` to skill chips.
- **Problem 8 (PDF Export - Feedback on Iteration 2)**: Skill chip alignment in PDF still problematic (likely wrapped line alignment).
- **Decision 8 (Iteration 3)**: Added `align-content-start` to the parent `div` of skill chips to control the alignment of wrapped lines.
- **Problem 9 (Icon System)**: User request to replace Font Awesome icons with emojis and remove Font Awesome.
- **Decision 9 (Completed)**: Replaced Font Awesome icons with emojis in `src/App.vue`, removed Font Awesome from `src/main.js` and `package.json`. Updated Memory Bank. Visual and functional testing completed. `npm install` is pending.
- **Problem 10 (Data Repetition)**: CV data in `src/cvs.json` was highly repetitive across different language/version combinations. User requested refactoring to a JS module to reduce duplication.
- **Decision 10 (In Progress)**:
    - Renamed `src/cvs.json` to `src/cvsData.js` and changed `App.vue` import.
    - Defined common constants in `cvsData.js` for `personal_info` (base), `education`, `honors_awards`, `references` (base), and skill sets (`frontendSkills`, `fullstackSkills`, `blockchainSkills`).
    - Updated all CV entries in `cvsCollection` within `cvsData.js` to use these constants for the respective sections.
    - Application tested and confirmed functional with these changes.
    - Next steps: Update memory bank, discuss deleting old `cvs.json`, and potentially refactor `experience` section further.
- **Current State**: CV data partially refactored into `src/cvsData.js` with significant de-duplication achieved for common sections and skills. New "Alloy" work experience (including external URL) added. Application is functional. `npm install` for Font Awesome removal still pending.
