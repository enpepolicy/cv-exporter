# Progress

## What Works (as of Vite Migration & Deployment Fix)

- **Local Development Server (`npm run dev`)**: Fully functional.
- **Dependencies**: All managed via npm and correctly bundled.
- **GitHub Action Build (`npm run build` in CI)**: Successful.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment Runtime (`https://enpepolicy.github.io/cv-exporter/`)**:
    - **Resolved**: Site was showing a blank page with a 404 error for `main.js`.
    - **Cause**: GitHub Pages deployment source was incorrectly set to `main` branch, `/ (root)` folder.
    - **Fix**: User updated GitHub Pages settings to serve from the `gh-pages` branch (or equivalent deployment branch), `/ (root)` folder.
    - **Status**: The site now loads and functions correctly.

## What's Left to Build / Verify

- **Labels in `cvs.json`**:
    - User needs to ensure that each CV object in `src/cvs.json` contains a `labels` object with appropriate translations for UI elements for full localization functionality (ongoing consideration).
- **General Testing**: Further testing of all features on the deployed site is always recommended.

## Current Status

- **Major Architectural Refactor Completed**: Project successfully migrated to a Vite-powered build system.
- **Dependency Management**: Switched from CDNs to npm.
- **Data Handling**: `cvs.json` is a local module, imported and transformed.
- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages and runtime issues resolved.
- **All critical issues related to the Vite migration and deployment are now resolved.**

## Known Issues

- **(Resolved)** GitHub Action build failure due to missing Font Awesome package.
- **(Resolved)** GitHub Pages serving incorrect files due to misconfigured deployment source, leading to 404 for `main.js`.
- **(Potential)** UI labels might not update correctly if `labels` objects are missing or incomplete in `src/cvs.json`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial State**: CDN-based, single `index.html`, `http-server`.
- **Problem 1**: Import map issues.
- **Decision 1**: Migrate to Vite.
- **Problem 2**: Local dev errors (Font Awesome).
- **Decision 2**: Add missing package.
- **Problem 3**: Local dev errors (CV data structure).
- **Decision 3**: Import `cvs.json` directly, implement `processCVs`.
- **Problem 4 (CI)**: GitHub Action build failing (Font Awesome).
- **Decision 4**: Confirmed and fixed `package.json`.
- **Problem 5 (Deployment Runtime)**: Deployed site shows 404 for `main.js`.
- **Decision 5**: Identified GitHub Pages source misconfiguration. User updated settings to point to `gh-pages` branch, `/ (root)` folder. **This resolved the issue.**
- **Current State**: Project is stable, built with Vite, and correctly deployed to GitHub Pages.
